		<h4>Week 2:</h4>
		<b>Date:</b> 9/3<br>
		<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
		<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
    	<br>This week I worked on standing up some basic testing environments/circuitry for Bluetooth testing as well as driver development testing on an STM32L0 microcontroller. 
	The goal for this week was to setup the development environment for the microcontroller and Bluetooth chip. 
	I worked first on setting up the testing environment for the microcontroller using LEDs to test my microcontroller drivers including initializing the GPIO registers, initializing the non-specific timer registers, and configuring individual pins for different modes. 
	I wrote the drivers with the intention of being able to easily bypass the low-level coding of bit operations and converting those into higher level functions. 
	I tested these drivers by setting up a simple LED circuit that toggled on and off LEDs with different timing initiatives if necessary. 
	Additionally, I completed writing drivers for setting up the ADC and SPI peripherals, but I have yet to begin testing for those.</br>
	<br><img src="Team/progress/ihagedorn/img/bluetooth.jpg" style="width:75%;height:50%;"></br>
	<br>
	For the Bluetooth testing, I setup a simple LED circuit, seen below, with an Arduino Uno that can turn on and off LEDS via wireless commands. 
	The incorporates an HC-05 which communicates with another Bluetooth device such as an Android phone to wirelessly transmit terminal commands.</br>
	<br>
	In addition to writing drivers and Bluetooth testing code, I also assisted in setting up the actual microcontroller development environment configurations in Eclipse and Github code repositories for the website, software code, and embedded software code. 
	During this time, I ran into several issues with the Eclipse environment and being able to flash the target device with built target over SWD. 
	The flashing of our microcontroller on a breakout board currently runs into an issue which results in unreliably flashing the device with about a 50 percent success rate while using the reset button. 
	The current theory is that this is a hardware issue with the breakout board, but further analysis will be needed to confirm this.</br>

		<h4>Week 3:</h4>
		<b>Date:</b> 9/10<br>
		<b>Total hours:</b> 11 <br>
		<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
	<br>
	This week was a bit slow since I was wrapped up in several club events and other various commitments.
	After starting the drivers last week, I was able to finish drivers for using the ADC and PWM with the DevBoard. 
	These drivers are tested and ready for capability testing with actual components such as a stepper motor and potentiometer for frequency tests and proof-of-concept tests. 
	Additionally, I received our Bluetooth chip this week and spent a considerable amount of time on board bring-up and integrating it into my original test setup for the HC-05. 
	This included checking the different pins on the breakout board and interfacing with chip with AT commands.
	</br>
	<br>
	On our microchip, I worked on resolving a flashing issue. 
	I began my debugging adventure verifying various connections on the bread board and researching the SWD protocol with STM32. 
	After verifying that all the breadboard connections checked out and the soldering points looked solid under a microscope, I brought up a new software environment in eclipse and tested it with the DevBoard. 
	Eventually I discovered that the debug configurations for our original environment was linked to the wrong ELF file and there have been zero issues flashing the chip henceforth.
	</br>
	<br>
	In addition to embedded development, I also helped out with project component analysis and software overview for this week. 
	In the project component analysis, I provided research and analysis for the Bluetooth chip selection and microcontroller selection. 
	Additionally, I helped create a state machine diagram below for our state logic and provided further details of the microcontrollerâ€™s operations within the project.
