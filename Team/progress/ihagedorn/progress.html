		<h4>Week 2:</h4>
		<b>Date:</b> 9/3<br>
		<b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
		<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
    	<br>This week I worked on standing up some basic testing environments/circuitry for Bluetooth testing as well as driver development testing on an STM32L0 microcontroller. 
	The goal for this week was to setup the development environment for the microcontroller and Bluetooth chip. 
	I worked first on setting up the testing environment for the microcontroller using LEDs to test my microcontroller drivers including initializing the GPIO registers, initializing the non-specific timer registers, and configuring individual pins for different modes. 
	I wrote the drivers with the intention of being able to easily bypass the low-level coding of bit operations and converting those into higher level functions. 
	I tested these drivers by setting up a simple LED circuit that toggled on and off LEDs with different timing initiatives if necessary. 
	Additionally, I completed writing drivers for setting up the ADC and SPI peripherals, but I have yet to begin testing for those.</br>
	<br><img src="Team/progress/ihagedorn/img/bluetooth.jpg" style="width:75%;height:50%;"></br>
	<br>
	For the Bluetooth testing, I setup a simple LED circuit, seen below, with an Arduino Uno that can turn on and off LEDS via wireless commands. 
	The incorporates an HC-05 which communicates with another Bluetooth device such as an Android phone to wirelessly transmit terminal commands.</br>
	<br>
	In addition to writing drivers and Bluetooth testing code, I also assisted in setting up the actual microcontroller development environment configurations in Eclipse and Github code repositories for the website, software code, and embedded software code. 
	During this time, I ran into several issues with the Eclipse environment and being able to flash the target device with built target over SWD. 
	The flashing of our microcontroller on a breakout board currently runs into an issue which results in unreliably flashing the device with about a 50 percent success rate while using the reset button. 
	The current theory is that this is a hardware issue with the breakout board, but further analysis will be needed to confirm this.</br>

		<h4>Week 3:</h4>
		<b>Date:</b> 9/10<br>
		<b>Total hours:</b> 11 <br>
		<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
	<br>
	This week was a bit slow since I was wrapped up in several club events and other various commitments.
	After starting the drivers last week, I was able to finish drivers for using the ADC and PWM with the DevBoard. 
	These drivers are tested and ready for capability testing with actual components such as a stepper motor and potentiometer for frequency tests and proof-of-concept tests. 
	Additionally, I received our Bluetooth chip this week and spent a considerable amount of time on board bring-up and integrating it into my original test setup for the HC-05. 
	This included checking the different pins on the breakout board and interfacing with chip with AT commands.
	</br>
	<br>
	On our microchip, I worked on resolving a flashing issue. 
	I began my debugging adventure verifying various connections on the bread board and researching the SWD protocol with STM32. 
	After verifying that all the breadboard connections checked out and the soldering points looked solid under a microscope, I brought up a new software environment in eclipse and tested it with the DevBoard. 
	Eventually I discovered that the debug configurations for our original environment was linked to the wrong ELF file and there have been zero issues flashing the chip henceforth.
	</br>
	<br>
	In addition to embedded development, I also helped out with project component analysis and software overview for this week. 
	In the project component analysis, I provided research and analysis for the Bluetooth chip selection and microcontroller selection. 
	Additionally, I helped create a state machine diagram below for our state logic and provided further details of the microcontroller’s operations within the project.

		<h4>Week 4:</h4>
		<b>Date: </b> 9/17<br>
		<b>Total hours: </b>15<br>
	<br>
	This week was mostly focused on setting up SPI, I2C, Bluetooth/UART, and testing. 
	I spent a majority of the week debugging the ZB7412-00 Bluetooth Low Energy chip since it didn’t seem to want to cooperate with my repeated attempts to interface with it over UART. 
	I have also tried re-flashing the chip with the production software using a provided SDK and IDE over J-Link; however, outside of the observed availability signals on the two JTAG pins, I can’t seem to get the chip to communicate. 
	Moving forward I’m looking to hookup every pin to a scope and recording its activity on power-up to see what is and isn’t happening. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Additionally, this week I worked on setting up the drivers and testing out the MCU’s SPI and I2C protocols in order to interface and command our IMU. 
	With the completion of these drivers I should be mostly finished with driver development and can move forward with creating header files along with integrating our pin mapping header file with these drivers. 
	I’m currently working on developing some SPI and I2C tests so that I can watch the signals over a scope and confirm their functionalities. 
	Additionally, I have been researching the commanding structure for the IMU so that I know what data to send it. 
	I currently have a detailed address mapping for for the IMU, but I have yet to come across how to command it using SPI.
	<br>
	<br>
	Finally, I worked on a macro test that integrated the drivers for the GPIOs, ADC, PWM, and timers into singular task, control the duty cycle of a LED using a potentiometer. 
	This setup is pictured below and can realistically control the frequency of the LED at a step size of about 0.7 mV as the potentiometer spans from 0 to 3 volts. 
	<br><img src="Team/progress/ihagedorn/img/breadboard.jpg" style="width:65%;height:50%;"></br>
	<br>
	On the non-technical side, I helped with the calculations for the different communication rates for the electrical overview and helped out on several bill of materials entries.
	<br>
	<br>
	Next week I hope to finalize SPI and I2C testing and resolve my Bluetooth development issue.
