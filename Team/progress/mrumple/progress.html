            <h2>Progress Report for Matthew Rumple</h2>
            
			<!-- Week 2 -->
            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 08/28/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 16 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week was filled with several activites including task delegation, team homework assignments, design decisions and testing. Each of these things were done throughout the week and are recorded below.
            <ul>
				<li>
					<b>Task Delegation</b><br>
					As the team leader I decided to make sure that each and every time member understood what their primary objectives were. It is important for each person to understand their personal goals and how they
					contribute to the overall team goals. With this in mind, I made sure to address the goals of each team member and check for their understanding of how important it was to team success. These goals were
					delegated according to each team member's skills and specialites, with motor and analog testing falling to Swag and I, software low-level driver development and testing to Isaac, and sensor fusion
					research to Zach. With all these tasks set, it set clear and easily achievable goals for each team member this week.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Team Homework Assignments</b><br>
					Both as a team and indiviually, we each contributed to the homework assignment due at the end of this week. While reviewing the other sections I worked primarily on the Mechanical, Thermal, and Economic
					constraints of our project. I was best suited to fill out most of these areas with having additional review from the other teammates. This document was using in highlighting some key functional
					specifications that are essential to our project actually becoming a product. It was very useful to perform some research on the ergonmics of handheld devices to determine that a target temperature of
					45 C for our device was acceptable. This gives our team a specific temperature target that we can run tests for to make sure it meets functional specifications. I also had the chance to research the
					prices of some competetive products that our product could replace, which helped determine a set price point for our total product cost, which was determined to be around $100.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Design Decisions</b><br>
					Several important design decisions were made this week, with many more on the way. The lectures helped us realize a few considerations that needed to be made to make sure we had the correct hardware for
					our application. We decided that if we could get a low-power micro with a FPU, we could use the micro to perform sensor fusion and then send the final output data over Bluetooth communications, lowering
					the amount of data we need to transmit to eventually conserve power. We also decided that it would be a good idea to test the robustness of I2C as an off-board communication solution. Odds are, we will
					see a serious problem with noise and will need to switch to some sort of differential signalling to achieve off-board communications.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Breakout Board Design</b><br>
					Both our Bluetooth and IMU modules have been ordered and need to be tested. Therefore, it was essential that a breakout board design be created so that we could test these chips using just a breadboard
					and any development microcontroller. These PCB's just needed to be an easy solution to testing the pinouts of these chips as well as testing the chips themselves. The breakout boards are also essential
					to double checking that the footprint was made correctly, so we can use the same SMD footprint in our final design. Both of these footprints were saved in the 
					<a href="https://github.com/ReverseExoskeleton/layouts">PCB Layout Repository</a> to allow for use in the entire team. We are aiming to have most of the footprints that are non-standard created by the 
					end of the next two weeks, making the PCB design process much easier. The breakout for IMU board can be seen in figure 1 while the breakout for the Bluetooth board can be seen in figure 2.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Passive Motor Breaking Test Apparatus</b><br>
					It was important that we determine the "breaking curve" of the motor we wanted to use. This curve would help us transform any non-linear torque curve into a linear curve that could adapt to the spinning
					speed of the motor. The data collected from this test would be instrumental to making sure that there is a consistent, quality haptic feedback generated by our passive motor system. This testing stand
					just utilizes an encoder, a stepper motor, and a few 3D printed parts to help measure the braking toqure of the motor when we change the duty cycle of the mechanical (hopefully to be opto-electronic) relays.
					A constant mass is tired to the end of a thin wire that is spooled around the main spoked spool attached to both the motor and encoder. The encoder allows us to watch the rotational speed of the motor
					shaft so we can determine the torque generated by the motor at different speeds. Also, since we have the measurements of the components of the system, the only missing variable is the torque generated
					by the motor, since we have the mass and lever distance from the center of the shaft. The Apparatus design can be seen in figure 3, while the physical testing stand can be seen in figure 4.

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 09/05/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 14 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week consisted of several different tasks, including selection of a different IMU with a breakout board to match, haptic feedback motor testing, as well as a meeting with Dr. Tan about our haptic feedback
			system. These events can be detailed below.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Different IMU Selection</b><br>
					A major disruption in our design plans this week was the realization that we needed a magnetomoter to add an additional 3 DOF to our sensor to help correct drift. At first we decided that we could just
					purchase the compatible Bosch part that links with our current 6 DOF IMU. Unfortunately, this part only comes in an extremely small BGA package (1.5mm x 1.5mm), which is just not feasible for our
					application. Therefore, we decided we needed to hunt for another IMU. We came across several valid canidates but all of them were out of stock. We finally decided to go with the IvenSense ICM-20948 as
					our new IMU. Although this raw chip is unavailable, we purchased several breakout boards from Sparkfun that could be used. Although it will be tough, we are going to desolder the part from the breakout
					so we can use it in our design. This new part is an LGA part which is much more acceptable for our application.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Passive Motor Torque Testing</b><br>
					While working on our IMU issues and researching possible fixes, we also decided to use our test rig and collect data to start plotting patterns and determining what our transfer function for applying
					haptic feedback would look like. We varied the duty cycle and PWM frequency to determine what kind of feedback we were receiving. We also had the oscilloscope connected to the rotary encoder of the
					apparatus so we could measure the angular rate as which the spool was spinning, vital for our physics calculations. All this data was collected and saved for post analysis.
					<br>
					Some interesting trends were found during post analysis, including the fact that our opto-electronic relays have a longer turn-on time due to the small current we are providing. This can be seen in
					Figure 7 and forced us to switch to a PWM frequency of 10Hz. This frequency generates an interesting haptic vibration that may or may not be desired (we will be talking to Professor Tan about that).
					This haptic ripple can be seen in the graph located in Figure 8. Figure 9 also shows a more concise data model of our current system, which will be translated into torque per duty cycle.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Meeting with Dr. Tan</b><br>
					Our meeting with Dr. Tan went extremely well. We spoke to her about several things including the haptic design of our project. There were several considerations that were brought up to her, and we
					plan on sending her some more linear acceleration data when we collect it. When we send her this data, it will help her understand what our system may feel like and how much we should increase the
					torque by (by gear reduction). While talking with Dr. Tan, we realized that we may not be shooting for resistance after all, but rather a haptic feedback warning. This passive haptic feedback will
					be the first of its kind and we are hoping to demonstrate this novelty in our design. She mentioned that we may want to utilize the "vibration" created by the PWM frequency (seen in Figure 8) to
					give the sensation of a signal. Figure 9 depicts the average velocity per duty cycle, sorted by PWM frequency. This graph helped us realize that we may not want to be creating much more resistance,
					but rather the perception of resistance.

			<!-- Week 4 -->
			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 09/12/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 14 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			There were several challenges this week that needed to be addressed. Some of these challenges were programming and interfacing with the bluetooth chip, gearbox design for the reduction of our motor, and the
			preliminary designs for our brace.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Bluetooth chip programming</b><br>
					After choosing and ordering our chip, we realized that the integrated MCU that runs the module actually came with a clean flash and no default program from the factory. This really worried the team as
					we did not want to be responsible for writing software for two micros. After taking a step back and looking into it, we realized that there is a TI supplied SDK for the CC2640R2F that comes inside the
					module we bought. We are currently in the process of determining how to program the module, but have high hopes that this SDK will do most of the heavy lifting for the BLE stack and let us focus on
					just the main STM micro of our system.
				<li>
					<b>Gearbox Design</b><br>
					Our motor needed to be lightweight but also provide a decent amount of torque so the user would notice the passive haptic feedback. In order to acheive this, we decided to go with a cyclodial gear
					reduction to increase the torque that our passive braking could provide. After talking with Dr. Tan we decided that we wanted to go with a 10:1 gera ratio to increase the torque our braking system
					provides by 100 times. The cyclodial gearbox was chosen due to it's ability to be reliabily 3D printed (no need for teeth that can wear down over use) and it's compact size. The only non-3D printed
					part is the ball bearing in the center and the screws to mount it, keeping the weight light as well. Up until this point the design has been going well except that the final output disk (the disk
					located at the top of figure 10) was not aligning correctly with the output holes on the cyclodial disk (the disk second from top with 10 lobes). If this design falls through, we believe that the
					vibrations generated by the motor alone will be ample enough for haptic feedback, but we would like to create a more demanding source of haptic feedback, so the gear reduction is still very important.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Preliminary Brace Designing</b><br>
					Another design task that was in the back of my mind is the brace design. We needed to start iterating on some of the more complex parts of the brace design to decide what is the best design for our
					final brace and packaging. Ideally this brace will fit many different arm shapes and sizes, be comfortable, and easy to slip on and off. All of these factors must be taken into account to allow for
					an elegant brace design to be built. A very rough brace sketch can be seen in figure 11, and will likely be iterated on over the next few weeks. Next week is the deadline for the mechanical overview,
					which includes a competetive analysis of other mechanical designs. I am very interested to see other brace designs and how they dealt with some of these challenges.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Created Most Schematic Symbols</b><br>
					In addition to the work that was done this week, I also created almost all of the schematic symbols for the Eeschema library we will be using to make our electrical schematics. These symbols will eventually
					be paired with their respective footprints to allow the create of the PCB layout and ultimately our final prototype. It was important to get these symbols done early so they can be used in preliminary
					schematics as well as they can be checked for consistency.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<!-- Week 5 -->
			<h4>Week 5:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 09/19/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 12 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			There was a lot of design work this week, from PCB's to mechanical design. There were several things that were researched while I was completing the mechanical overview. While I was working on the mechanical aspects,
			I also decided to look into some communication issues we have been experiencing with the IMU.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Mechanical Design Research</b><br>
					Throughout the mechanical overview and commercial analysis, I learned a lot of good design practices for the packaging of our product. For starters, I found that introducing a 2-strap mounting method instead of
					a single strap mounting method would maintain two points of contact for each section of the arm, keeping the orientation of the brace static, making sure that the brace did not twist or rotate in any weird
					directions. I also learned that it is important to mount as much mass as possible to the upper-arm section, since anything mounted to the lower arm section will be rotating whenever the user rotates their elbow.
					These design considerations along with several padding and distance suggestions will allow the system to be lightweight, portable, non-obstructive, and overall pleasent to wear. Figure 12 displays the preliminary
					CAD drawings of the mechanical system, including some basic dimenions.

						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>
					<b>PCB Design Considerations</b><br>
					The design of our product proved to be interesting when determining the design of the PCBs. Due to the nature of our system, we thought it would be best to isolate the noise inducing components (such as the haptic
					feedback and energy harvesting components) from the main logic of our system. Therefore, we decided to split our PCB into two PCBs, that would ony need power lines and a PWM line in between them. This split would
					make each PCB simplier in the long run as well as reduce the possibilty of noise making debugging hard. We also decided that both PCBs will be mounted to the upper arm portion of the brace, since the IMU needs to
					be mounted to the upper arm and the motor will be mounted to the upper arm portion as well.
					
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>IMU Communication Issues</b><br>
					Lately, we have been having issues communicating with the IMU over SPI, and Zach needs the IMU data (through the Bluetooth stream or emulation) in order to continue development on the sensor fusion algorithms. In order
					to acheive this, I decided to wire up an ESP32 Feather board running Micro Python to communicate to the IMU over I2C. I2C may not be our final communication method, but we need to confirm that this IMU does what we want
					it to and can give us the data we want. I am planning on writing a simple micro-python script to stream IMU data over the serial port so that it can be ported into unity. Ideally, this could be abstracted to the same
					application level that the Bluetooth stream would be, allowing for quick swapping between the Bluetooth interface and the IMU emulation. Unfortunately, the first I2C test proved to be uneventful, as the device did not
					respond to commands sent over the line, I will be checking these lines with a logic analyzer soon...

			<!-- Week 6 -->
			<h4>Week 6:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 09/26/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 18 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week was a mostly hardware design with a dash of mechanical detail. The printed circuit board for the HBmS was routed and the schematic was finalized. We realized the need to test the HBmS was extremely important, so we opted
			to print this board as soon as possible.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>IMU Communication Issues</b><br>
					Thankfully, Isaac was able to get SPI working while attempting to contact the IMU. Apparently, the IMU needed to be addressed first, similar to I2C protocol, but responded correctly after that. This is a huge relief because
					we can now focus our attention on the Bluetooth module communications. This is one of the most crucial parts of our design and needs to be figured out as soon as possible. Once the Bluetooth module communication issues are
					figured out, we can fully route the second PCB confidently, allowing us more time for printed hardware debugging.

				</li>
				<li>
					<b>HBmS PCB Routing</b><br>
					After a couple nights of work, the HBmS PCB has been finalized and routed. This is the main analog component of our design, so we wanted a chance to iterate over the design a second time if we needed to. This allows us some
					room for error if our PCB doesn't work the first time. This also allows me the chance to start working on the mechanical design a little more, to start accomodating for the HBmS PCB on the physical packaging. Hopefully this
					board will show up within a week or so so that we can start the testing procedures for the HBmS. The system interface to the DAqS is simple enough that it can be replicated by an AD2, allowing for easy test bench setup.
					Testing the haptic feedback and battery components of our design now will greatly improve the chances of our project's success. The front and back copper layers can be seen in figure 14 and 15 respectively.

					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>HBmS Mechanical Considerations</b><br>
					Routing this board has given me the opportunity to start designing the enclosure for the HBmS board, power switch, and battery. These mechanical designs are bettery to complete and get out of the way, as the mechanical design
					is also very important to the success of this project. Therefore, I will be modeling the 3D CAD model of this board, along with some of the mechanical components that will house several sub components. This design will be for the
					lower part of the upper arm portion of the device. I will most likely be modeling these items over this weekend, and they will be reported in more detail next progress report.

			<!-- Week 7 -->
			<h4>Week 7:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 10/03/2021<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 34 hours<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			This week was a very long week, with lots of problems solved, and lots of progress made. Most of the notable progress would be the mechanical design of the brace itself, the layout for the DAqS PCB, and the gearbox design and fabrication.
			All of these things alone took a considerable amount of time, and together they took up a huge chunk of my week.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Brace Design and CAD</b><br>
					A lot of work needed to be done in order to get the mechanical base design figured out. After some work with Swagat, I was able to come up with a solid design that would accomodate both of our boards, the power switch, and be sized
					appropriately for the user's arm. These constraints were taken into account while we were CADing the first preliminary design for the upper-arm section. The lower arm should be relatively easy since it is effectively just a mount to
					the user's forearm. Due to some board layout issues, the board needed to be a bit longer than we were expecting, but that was okay, since the mechanical design was not set in stone, so we were able to stretch the length of the package
					slightly to accomodate the longer board size. Each of the connectors needed to be accesible while the board was mounted in the package, except for the programming connector, so all of that was taken into account. Overall, this is a
					very solid preliminary design and will definitely be refined over the next few weeks. A screenshot from the CAD model for the current brace assembly can be seen in Figure 16.

					</li>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>DAqS PCB Layout</b><br>
					A majority of my time this week was spent working on this PCB. The number of components and rough space constraints made this PCB very densely packed, and I have only minor experience with PCB layout and design. After a couple restarts
					of component placement, I was able to get something relatively well laid out, that was compact and isolated. We decided to have 3 separate ground planes, one for analog, one for digital, and one for power, which allowed us to connect
					them in only one area, so we could have separate planes that would not create a ground loop. The Front and Back of the preliminary DAqS PCB layout can be seen in Figures 18 and 19 respectively. As seen in Figure 18, the board is split
					into two sections, analog and digital, keeping the two planes separate. This PCB layout needs some refinement, which is where Swagat will come in and polish up the design since he is more experienced in electrical engineering. This board
					ended up being larger than our original constraints, but we decided it was best not to push the limits, but rather give ourselves some breathing room.

				</li>
				<li>
					<b>24:5 Gearbox Design and Fabrication</b><br>
					Lastly, the gearbox was almost completed, with the exception of a few minor adjustments. We now have a working 24:5 gear reduction for our stepper motor that will increase both the haptic feedback as well as the energy harvesting.
					This gear reduction should be un-noticable to anyone wearing the device, since the starting torque of the stepper is so small, but it will hopefully create a more noticeable haptic feedback when the motor is shorted, as well as
					spinning the motor more times to generate more back EMF to harvest. Since we created our own gearbox, we were able to make it assymetric to load some of the weight of the stepper back about 20 mm from the elbow joint, hopefully
					increasing the comfortability of our device. It is also relatively compact when compared to other gerabox options, which means that our system can have a lower profile than if we were forced to use a pre-made gerabox. Although it
					seemed like a difficult challenge at first, it only took a little CAD knowledge and some tolerancing to acheive something that will improve our project greatly. Also, just in case the gerabox fails for some reason, we decided to
					make the mounting holes for the box the exact same as a stepper, so the two would be interchangable.
