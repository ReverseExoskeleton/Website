			<h2>Progress Report for Zach Ghera</h2>
			
			<h4>Week 2 (8/30)</h4>

						Determined the hardware necessary for wireless communication.
						<br>
						The first step I took was researching BLE versus alternatives
						such as RF (specifically ZigBee) to see which would be a more
						viable for our project. More specifically, the choosen wireless
						communication method needs to have:
						<ul>
							<li>Low power consumption and (ideally) 1.8V source voltage</li>
							<li>Low latency</li>
							<li>Low cost</li>
						</ul>
						In addition to looking at some of the most popular (available)
						chips for both

							BLE

						and 
						<a href="https://www.digikey.jp/products/en/rf-if-and-rfid/rf-transceiver-modules-and-modems/872?FV=1989%7C0%2C-8%7C872%2C578%7C423589&quantity=0&ColumnSort=0&page=1&stock=1&pageSize=25&pkeyword=xbee">
							RF/Zigbee
						</a>
						, one valuable source to help inform the decision was 
						<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271327094_On_the_Potential_of_Bluetooth_Low_Energy_Technology_in_Vehicular_Applications">
							this paper on the Potential of Bluetooth Low Energy
							Technology in Vehicular Applications
						</a>
						. As summarized in the Comparison between BLE and ZigBee section,
						BLE offers a faster data rate, lower latency, lower cost, and
						more robust in the presence of strong WiFi interference.
						Therefore, I recommended that we proceed with buying a BLE chip.
						<br>
						I then did some research to get a sense of what are some of the
						most popular BLE controllers. 
						<a href="https://developex.com/blog/most-popular-ble-controllers/">
							This blog
						</a>
						was one of many websites that I referenced alongside filtering
						through different bluetooth chips on the digikey website. After
						some review of the available parts, I chose the 
						<a href="https://www.digikey.jp/product-detail/en/jorjin-technologies-inc/ZB7412-00/2393-ZB7412-00CT-ND/12142962">
						ZB7412 module 
						</a>
						based on the TI CC26xx BLE controller. The main primary rationale
						behind this choice was that it had the second lowest current
						consumption (behind the DA 14580 which had no available BLE modules).

					</li>
					<li>
						Confirmed ability to disable IMU (
						<a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bosch-sensortec/BHI160B/9674245?s=N4IgTCBcDaIBxjgWgIwAY4E5VIHIBEQBdAXyA">
							BHI160B
						</a>
						) fusion core. 
						<br>
						After the team ordered a few IMUs, I found that this particular IMU
						had an onboard "fusion core" that allows a client to read from
						"virtual sensors." These sensors are available via on-chip sensor
						fusion.
						<br>
						If we were not concerned about about keeping the wearable low-power,
						it would be an obvious choice to use the IC sensor fusion result to
						obtain arm orientation (angular displacement). However, this fusion
						core is responsible for around 35% of the power consumption of the
						module during "significant motion" (see Table 13 from BHI160B
						datasheet attached below).
						<br>
						<img src="/web/Team/progress/zghera/bhi160b_table_13_power_consumption.jpg" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
						<br>
						Thus, the ability to disable the fusion core and perform this
						computation on the host would save up to ~1 mA which would translate
						to ~1.8mW. For reference, the analog event detector consumes 0.7mW.
						<br>
						Based on section 9.4 in the BHI160B datasheet, it appears you can
						disable the fusion core so that it will only draw ~7uA.
					</li>
					<li>
						Functional Specification
						<br>
						I completed the functional description, expected use case,
						computational constraints, and functional block diagram sections
						of the report.
						<br>
						Please see a picture of the RevEx functional block diagram I created below.
